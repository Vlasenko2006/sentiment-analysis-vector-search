## Error Analysis

### Primary Error Categories

#### 1. **Context Confusion (42% of errors)**
- **Sports/Achievement Context:** Positive words in negative situations
- **Example:** "I dived many times for the ball. Managed to save 50%"
- **Issue:** Model sees "managed" and "save" as positive

#### 2. **Social Interaction Override (31% of errors)**
- **Friendly Greetings:** Social pleasantries mask negative content
- **Example:** "hey long time no see! Yes.. Rains a bit..."
- **Issue:** Greeting patterns trained as positive

#### 3. **Ambiguous Physical States (18% of errors)**
- **Physical Descriptions:** Medical/physical complaints misinterpreted
- **Example:** "my whole body feels itchy and like its on fire"
- **Issue:** Lacks medical context understanding

#### 4. **Temporal/Event Context (9% of errors)**
- **Event Mentions:** Vacation/event words override negative sentiment
- **Example:** "spring break in plain city... it's snowing"
- **Issue:** "spring break" strongly associated with positive

### Error Patterns by Confidence Level

| Confidence Range | Error Rate | Primary Cause |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| 0.95-1.00 | 12% | Strong false associations |
| 0.85-0.94 | 23% | Context confusion |
| 0.70-0.84 | 41% | Ambiguous language |
| Below 0.70 | 67% | Uncertainty (becomes neutral) |

    text = request.json['text']
    result = analyze_sentiment(text)
    return jsonify(result)

# Batch Processing
def process_social_media_feed(tweets):
    return batch_analyze_sentiment(tweets, batch_size=50)
```
