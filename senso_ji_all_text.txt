Spacious Ueno Park is a great place to relax and visit a variety of different museums and galleries. At Ameyoko which starts in front of Ueno station, the grocery stores and clothing shops are crammed alongside fishmongers. It gets particularly busy at the end of the year, when many people go on shopping sprees. The town of Asakusa, developed around Sensoji temple, has many shops selling goods and clothing from old Japan, making it a great place for souvenir hunting. It's also known for various annual festivals, and the whole district gets involved with the huge Sanja Festival in May.Read moreReach out directlyVisit websiteCallBest nearbyRestaurants10,000 within 3

with a mix of excitement and weariness as visitors navigate through throngs of people. As you make your way through this vibrant locale, it becomes essential to avoid the tourist traps that often lure unsuspecting travelers, such as the enticing offer to pay 100 yen for a fortune note, only to find that you might need to spend another 200 yen to negate the bad fortune that is all too common. Such practices can be frustrating and detract from the genuine experience of exploring the temple and its surrounding culture. However, amidst the hustle and bustle, there is a refreshing sense of cleanliness and order that stands out. The temple grounds are meticulously maintained, with lush greenery providing a stark contrast to the urban sprawl. The intricate architecture of the temple itself invites admiration, with its ornate carvings and vibrant colors telling stories of ancient traditions and spiritual significance. Visitors are encouraged to take their time, soaking in the serene environment, and perhaps engaging with local artisans or sampling traditional snacks from nearby vendors. This place, while bustling with tourists, also offers pockets of tranquility where one can reflect and appreciate the cultural heritage that thrives here. It’s worth venturing beyond the surface attractions to discover the deeper meanings and experiences that await those who seek them, making this journey not just about sightseeing, but about connecting with the spirit of the place.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited July 2025Traveled as a coupleWritten July 21, 2025ThorwaldVikingAsgaarWinter Park, Florida215 contributions5 of 5 bubblesSensō-ji is a Buddhist temple located in Asakusa. The colourful and popular temple features the Kaminarimon Gate (Thunder Gate) at the entrance. From this gate onwards, locals and tourists walk along Nakamise-Dori, a historic street lined with souvenir shops until they reach the second gate, the Hozomon. Outside the main hall and pagoda of Tokyo’s oldest temple, there is a fountain for washing hands, small stalls selling charms and rows of drawers for visitors to read their fortune for the day. The temple grounds offer ample photo opportunities around the trading hours of Nakamise-Dori when there are no crowds. If you decide to visit early in the morning, be wary of the shadows cast on some of the temple buildings from the surrounding skyscrapers. The main hall is open daily from 6am – 5pm, the temple grounds are always open and entrance is free.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited June 2025Traveled with familyWritten June 23, 2025SPAZIO_INFINITOTurin, Italy3,132 contributions4 of 5 bubblesTraveling around Tokyo we decided to visit the majestic Buddhist complex of Senso-ji. Located in Tokyo in the district of Asakusa (northeast), not far from the Skytree tower, easily accessible on foot and by public transport (the nearest subway station is Asakusa). The Senso-ji is one of the oldest and most important Buddhist temples in the city of Tokyo. It consists of numerous buildings made entirely of wood (painted in bright colors), enclosed within a green area with small Japanese-style gardens (very well maintained) and bodies of water with colorful carp. There was a very quiet and spiritual atmosphere thanks also to the aromas of incense burning around the temple. It is a very visited attraction, not only by tourists but also by the Japanese, I recommend stopping at Senso-ji during the week (early morning) if you want to take nice pictures in peace. Access to the temple is free, only the internal areas are reserved for the faithful. Upon our arrival a religious service was taking place with prayers by Buddhist monks (an emotional moment, very nice). Appropriate behavior and especially silence near the prayer area is required. Along the streets leading to the temple there are countless shops where you can buy souvenirs of all kinds. It takes about an hour to visit the temple complex. It was a pleasant visit, refreshing and spiritual. I would definitely recommend it.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited September 2024Traveled as a coupleWritten December 22, 2024Traveler CLos Angeles, California556 contributions5 of 5 bubblesWe visited Sensō-ji Temple on a beautiful day and enjoyed exploring the area and taking photos. The warm weather made it perfect for enjoying the site and walking through the grounds. The temple was vibrant as it is located in the densely populated city of Tokyo. Make sure to stop by the majestic Thunder Gate at the main entrance; it’s great for taking photos and appreciating Japanese architecture.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited March 2025Traveled with familyWritten April 17, 2025DineshToronto, Canada302 contributions3 of 5 bubblesWe did the walking tour with Localized Walking and Food tours and the guide was quite nice and friendly. He explained the history of the place and kept the walking at a decent pace. To be honest though, it is really not much of a tour, you are better off reading on the place and trying to come in early in the morning or later in the evening. It was quite crowded and there were lineups for several of the food stalls. Except for local shopping, I would give the place a miss!!Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited October 2025Traveled with familyWritten October 27, 2025davazno1Timisoara, Romania774 contributions5 of 5 bubblesObviously a top , must see destination if you ever visit Tokyo . Large temple complex with a multitude of shops in the vicinity , basically every type of shop/eatery you need (excelent currency exchange , restaurants , souvenirs etc etc ) Accessible from everywhere in Tokyo via metro , the temple can be visited free of charge but closes at 5 pm , visiting the area and the temple should take at leas 5 hours . I have visited during 7-21 Apr 2025 , the only bad things to say is that the temple itself is closing at 5:00 pm and there are too many tourists everywhere no matter the day or time .Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited April 2025Traveled with friendsWritten April 23, 2025yoko aHokkaido, Japan192 contributions5 of 5 bubblesThe vastness of this temple is amazing and includes not only the main hall, but also the surrounding land, including a small temple, gardens, cemetery and goldfish. It's also very easy to get there. It is very crowded during the day and many groups of schools visit this temple, so it is better to go early in the morning. Sensoji Temple and the surrounding area are must-see places in Tokyo. So while you should be prepared to be extremely crowded on arrival, it's still well worth it. You can also purchase a meal at a nearby booth before or after visiting the temple. It is easy to get to with a subway station nearby.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited November 2024Traveled with familyWritten November 6, 2024Soumya NayakDubai, United Arab Emirates705 contributions4 of 5 bubblesI am sure this is one of the most visited shrines, going by thousands of tourists who were present at 9:00 AM. Picking the fortune stick is one of the most popular activities to indulge in. Those who get good & regular fortunes can carry the paper while those who get the bad fortune, should tie the paper on a string in the temple, which means to let go of the bad fortune, before returning home. The streets around the temple have several shops selling food & souvenirs. A little farther from the temple is a shopping area with kimono rentals. We saw some tourists dressed in kimono while visiting the temple.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited July 2025Traveled with familyWritten July 25, 2025Hamid H1 contribution5 of 5 bubblesI had a great time at the Senso-ji Temple. Loved that despite its "tourist" status, this temple complex remains a model of Japanese tradition The temple, like the rest of the Asakusa area, suffered greatly from air raids during World War II. But the square around here has been rebuilt, and today it is noisy, fun, lots of tourists and even Japanese in kimonos who come to the temple to pray. I advise you to come here in the morning if you want peace and quiet, or in the evening if you are interested in trying street food and walking along the shopping street with traditional Japanese flashlights and a huge selection of souvenirs.Read moreReview of: Senso-ji TempleVisited September 2025Traveled soloWritten September 15, 2025TheShisTel Aviv, Israel46,227 contributions4 of 5 bubblesThis is a fantastic shrine, which is also Tokyo's oldest.

She gave us an excellent history lesson on the temple, how it was started, how Tokyo transformed over time and became the capital of Japan, and so much more. She was delightful. The tour lasted about 2 hours. Unfortunately, we got a bit of a late start because our group did not connect with her right away. We arrived on time at the location that we were told but had to search for her.The temple grounds are very crowded with lots of tourists. It was a challenge to get pictures because there was always someone in the background.There were no lines or crowds to get a fortune, or to buy incense sticks. THere was a crowd to pray.There are lots of things to see on the grounds so give yourself plenty of time to walk around.If you have the chance, sign up for the Kimono and Matcha Tea Ceremony Experience. If you do, you will get dressed up in a kimono and can go back to the temple to take pictures in your kimono.Read moreWritten October 11, 2025This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I’d been watching videos of Shibuya Crossing, where every two minutes thousands of pedestrians scramble across the intersection of seven streets. Would the city be this overcrowded and difficult to navigate? It turns out that Tokyo is incredibly easy to explore, with easy-to-read signage and a public transportation system that’s a no-brainer. With some pointers, I was easily hopping from Buddhist shrines to fish markets. I even got to experience Shibuya Crossing with zero heart palpitations. And as I built up my Tokyo expertise, I honed down my list of must-dos and my approach to cover them all.By Mark SullivanThe perfect 3 days in TokyoJul 4, 2025 • 12 min readWhen you visit Tokyo for the first time, you can’t just wing it. You’ll definitely need a plan to see the fabulous fashions of Ginza, the colorful anime of Akihabara, the effortless cool of Shibuya, and the many-tiered temples of Asakusa—all essentials for first-time visitors—in three days.
